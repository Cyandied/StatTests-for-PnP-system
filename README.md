# StatTests
Some simulations for diffrent ways of throwing dice around.
## My result at 5000 cases:
### Methods of rolling dice to get numbers between -4 and 4
|| -4 | -3 | -2 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|4dF:|1.0%|5.0%|13.0%|20.0%|23.0%|20.0%|12.0%|5.0%|1.0%|

### Chance of death in different situations, W - willpower SR, H - amount of times recived help
|| min 2 | min 3 | min 4 |

### Checking consistancy of dice rolls on small sample sizes
The d20 was more consistant 2224.0 out of 5000 times of 20 rolls.
The d20 was more consistant 44% if the time.
The d20's average consistancy: 75%, the 3d6: 74%

The d20 was more consistant 3149.0 out of 5000 times of 2000 rolls.
The d20 was more consistant 63% if the time.
The d20's average consistancy: 75%, the 3d6: 74%
